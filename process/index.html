			<h3>
	Pre-Season</h3>
<p>
	The TechHOUNDS don't just sit idle from August to January waiting for the game to be announced. During the pre-season, we spend the majority of our time introducing new members to the wide array of software and tools that we use to design and build our robot, website, and publications. Returning members and mentors take the time to get to know the newcomers and mentor "rookies" within their respective divisions. The team also works on obtaining sponsorships and strengthening the sense of community and team bonding.</p>
<h3>
	Week 1 - Brainstorm</h3>
<p>
	In the first week of each build season, all the members -regardless of division- come together to brainstorm a plan for the game. The kickoff meeting takes place in early January immediately after FIRST announces the game. Key goals for these meetings include developing strategies for how to best overcome the challenges of each game and how to be a unique alliance member during the competition.s Students are guided by returning members and mentors to develop ideas that are both creative and practical: vital components in the field of engineering.</p>
<h3>
	Week 2 - Prototype</h3>
<p>
	As we enter the second week, the ideas that have been gathered and finalized from the first week are conglomerated into several functioning prototypes, made almost entirely of wood. These prototypes are then tested extensively to check for design flaws and logistical impossibilities. During this testing process, we pit the prototypes against each other to determine the most effective design. This design will then be used to form the foundation of the robot we submit to our competitions.</p>
<h3>
	Week 3 - CAD</h3>
<p>
	The third week consists of taking the best prototype ideas and assembling them into one robot using Autodesk Inventer software to "CAD" the final design. CAD stands for Computer Aided Design and the entire robot is drawn in the CAD software before the team is allowed to begin constructing the final parts needed for the robot. This practice reflects the real life policies of many engineering companies across the world, further developing the fundamental techniques that are required in engineering fields.</p>
<h3>
	Week 4 - Construction</h3>
<p>
	Now deep into the build season, the team cuts and forms the pieces of the final body of the robot. Using the designs we CAD'ed up in the prior week, the team begins to create all the components and learns how the parts all come together. During this time, the programmers also begin developing the code that allows the robot to perform the challenge dictated by FIRST. In doing so, they work closely with the Electrical Division to ensure the stability of the robot.</p>
<h3>
	Week 5 - Assembly</h3>
<p>
	With the deadline approaching ever so quickly, the team assembles the parts into a functioning robot. During this time, the team has to develop and enact efficient methods of designing the robot. To do so, the Electrical, Robot Ops, and Programming divisions collaborate to engineer the robot. They must also develop a way of rapidly repairing the robot during the competitions, in the event that our robot should become damaged during its performance.</p>
<h3>
	Week 6 - Test</h3>
<p>
	The robot is now complete and the team begins a series of extensive tests and adjustments in order to get the robot to competing level. The most important of these tests is subjecting the final robot to realistic simulations of the competition using the wooden models of the field developed in the early weeks of the build season. Any flaws in performance or design can be adjusted at this time. As the build season comes to an end, the IT and Public Relations divisions come together to finalize the visual and creative aspects of the team's website.</p>
<h3>
	Competition Season</h3>
<p>
	With the build season now complete, out robot is "bagged and tagged" - the robot is locked away and all further changes to the robot are stopped. During this time, we anxiously await our opportunities to compete at our upcoming competitions, such as the Boilermaker and Crossroads Regionals.</p>
