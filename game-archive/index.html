	  end of the field. Once scored, balls are returned through a hanging guardrail system.
	  Points may be earned in the end game by climbing onto the platform located on the bumps

	  will receive ten points for each robot that is in the End Zone. An additional ten points will be
	  added if the stretcher is in the End Zone. The alliance doubles its score if the bridge is
	  balanced. The alliance multiplies its score by a factor of up to three by ending the match before
	  the two minute time limit. Each team receives the alliance score. A team multiplies its’ score by
	  1.1 if its large ball is on top of a goal. Scores are rounded up to the nearest whole point after

	<i>Contestants attempt to place as many of their soccer balls
	  possible inside one of two goals. In each match, three-team
	  alliances compete to place 12 balls of their team color
	  inside either the high goal, worth 3 points, or in the low goal,
	  worth one point per ball. The winner is the team that has
	  the highest total point value of soccer balls within the two
	  goals at the end of the two-minute match. In the case of a
	  tie, the team with more balls in the upper goal wins.

	<i>Contestants attempt to collect balls from either the playing
	  field or their opponents’ goals, place them in their own
	  goals, and defend them. There are five large air-filled kick
	  balls each worth five points, and twenty smaller water-filled
	  balls worth one point each. The winner is the team with the
	  highest total point value of balls within their goal at the
	  conclusion of a two-minute match. In the case of a tie, the
	  team with the most large balls wins. If still a tie, the team
